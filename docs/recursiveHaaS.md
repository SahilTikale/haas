# Recursive HaaS

## Introduction:

Recursive HaaS is a framework by which HaaS 
service can be deployed over a subset of hardware and network resources 
procured from a pre-existent  HaaS enabled infrastructure. 



Recursive HaaS serves a two fold purpose:-
* Enable research and development:
    * New features can be added and tested at scale 
    	without affecting production enviornment.

* Independence to tenants to further segregate their resources
    * Using recursive HaaS, a tenant can further segregate and
    	distribute the hardware resources transparently from Base HaaS


##Deploying Recursive HaaS:

Sample haas.cfg template for deploying recursive haas is available in
`haas/examples/haas.cfg.recursive`

## Using Recursive HaaS:
Examples about how to get started with recursive HaaS (rHaaS)
is provided in `haas/docs/usingRecursiveHaaS.md`
