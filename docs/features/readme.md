Introducing new features to HIL
--------------------------------

This [template file](newFeatureSpecificationTemplate.md) provides a way to 
describe different aspects of the new feature that you wish to propose for HIL.

Make a copy of the template and add it to [indiscussion](indiscussion) folder.
and make a pull request on that. 

Once the feature is approved and you start working on the feature, 
move the template to [ongoing](ongoing) folder.

Once the feature is accepted in HIL, i.e related PR is merged, 
move the specification document from ongoing to 
[implemented](implemented) directory.
